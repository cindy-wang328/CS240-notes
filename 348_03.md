# Intro to SQL
The set of relations in a database are specified using data definition language (DDL), to give information about each relation
- schema, types of values of attributes
- integrity constraints
- set of indices
- security/authorization
- physical storage on the disk
Basic SQL types
- char(n): fixed-length character string with user-specified length n.
- varchar(n): variable-length character string with user-specified maximum length n
	- char(10) vs varchar(1): "123" would be "123       " as a char but "123" as a varchar
	- when comparing 2 chars, extra spaces are attached to the shorter char. if comparing char with varchar, extra spaces may or may not be added to varchar.
		- usually, use varchar instead of char, avoid the extra spaces problem
- int: integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent)
- smallint: A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).
- numeric(p, d): fixed-point number with user-specified precision. 
	- The number consists of p digits (plus a sign), and d of the p digits are to the right of the decimal point. 
	-  numeric(3,1) allows 44.5 to be stored exactly, but neither 444.5 nor 0.32 can be stored exactly in a field of this type.
- real, double precision: Floating-point and double-precision floating-point numbers, with machine-dependent precision.
- float(n): A floating-point number with precision of at least n digits.

## Creating tables
create table <table name> (Attribute1 Type1, Attr2 Type2, ..., <integrity constraint 1>, <constraint 2>...);
```
create table department
	(dept_name varchar(20),
	building varchar(15),
	budget numeric (12,2), -- means a number with 12 digits total, 2 of which are after the decimal point
	primary key (dept_name));
```
SQL is insensitive to white space and case for keywords (but is sensitive in strings)

Integrity constraints
- Primary key (Ak1, Ak2, ..., Akn): No typle can have any null values in a pkey attribute, 2 tuples can't have equal values of all primary attributes
- Foreign key: `foreign key (Ak1, Ak2, ..., Akn) references s` indicates all the attributes Ak corresponds to values of the primary key attributes in relation `s`
- not null constraint

### Drop table
Drop table <table_name> deletes all info about the dropped relation from the database. It can't be used until it is recreated with "create table"

delete from <table_name> deletes all tuples in the table but retains the schema (the relation)
### Altering tables
`alter table r add A D;` addes attribute with name A and type D to relation r. The values will be null initially
`alter table r drop A;` drops the attribute A

# Basic SQL queries (select, from, where)
Also called SPJ select project join: select A1..An from R1..Rm where cond; corresponds to Project A1..An (Select condition (R1 X R2 X... X Rm))

Select From Where is actually Select Where From because it does the cartesian product, then applies the condition, then projects the columns
- `SELECT 2020-age FROM User WHERE name="Lisa";` gets the year Lisa was born
	- select clause can contain arithmetic expressions on constants or attributes of tuples (can `select salary * 1.1 from instructor`)
- `select distinct` eliminates duplicates

## Queries on multiple relations
`SELECT Group.gid, Group.name FROM User, Member, Group WHERE User.uid = Member.uid AND Member.gid = Group.gid AND User.name LIKE '%Simpson%';` to get the IDs and names of groups, with a user, whose name contains "Simpson"
- LIKE matches a string against a pattern
	- % matches any substring, `_` matches any one character (can use `__` to match 2 chars, `___%` matches any string of >=3 chars)
- can omit table_name in table_name.column_name if the col name is unique
- the `from` clause generates a Cartesian product: for each t1 in r1, for each t2 in r2, ... concatenate them into a single tuple and add to result

`SELECT m1.uid AS u1, m2.uid AS u2 FROM Member AS m1, Member AS m2 WHERE m1.gid = m2.gid AND m1.uid > m2.uid;`
- this is ids of all pairs of users that belong to the same group
- AS keyword is for renaming, is optional (`FROM User u1, User u2` also works)

## Set and bag operations
Project age (user) and SELECT age FROM User are different - the projection eliminates duplicates and returns all possible user ages, while the select returns all of them (the distribution). Can enforce set semantics with DISTINCT 
- `SELECT DISTINCT m1.uid AS uid1, m2.uid AS uid` 

Union, Except, Intersect: eliminate duplicates in input tables first, then also eliminate duplicates in the result (for UNION), Exactly like U, -, and intersect in relational algebra

Union/Except/Intersect ALL: Bag semantics; think of each row as having a count of how many times it appears
- Bag union sums the counts, bag difference "proper" subtracts (negative is 0), bag intersect takes the minimum of counts
- for `Poke(uid1, uid2, time)`:
	-  `SELECT uid1 FROM poke EXCEPT SELECT uid2 FROM poke` is users who poked others, but never got poked by others
	-  `SELECT uid1 FROM poke EXCEPT ALL SELECT uid2 FROM poke` is users who poked others **more than** others poked them


# Subqueries
### Table Subqueries
Use a query result as a table, in FROM clauses, set and bag operations. Any select-from-where expression returns a relation as a result, and can be inserted as a subquery into another select-from-where. Can also use the WITH keyword to define a temp relation which is available only to the query where the with clause is.

Ex. the names of users who poked others more than others poked them
```
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM User,
	((SELECT uid1 AS u FROM Poke)
	EXCEPT ALL
	(SELECT uid2 AS u FROM Poke))
  AS T
WHERE User.uid = T.uid;
```

### Scalar subqueries
A query that returns a single row can be used as a value in `WHERE`, `SELECT` etc statements.
- ex. users that are the same age as Bart: `SELECT * FROM User WHERE age=(SELECT age FROM user WHERE name='Bart');`
- if the subquery returns null rows it is NULL, returns more than 1 row it is error

### IN subqueries
`x IN (subquery)` checks if x is in the result of subwuery
- ex. users at the same age as Bart: `SELECT * FROM User WHERE age IN (SELECT age FROM user WHERE name='Bart');`
- Most popular user: `SELECT * FROM user WHERE uid NOT IN (SELECT u1.uid FROM User AS u1, User AS u2 WHERE u1.pop < u2.pop);`

### EXISTS
Checks if the result of subquery is non empty. 
- `SELECT * FROM User AS u WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM User WHERE name='Bart' AND age=u.age);`
	- for each row u in User, evaluate the subquery with the value of u.age. if the result is not empty, output u.* 


### Scope of subqueries
Start from the immediately surrounding query; if not found, look in the one surrounding that. Use table.column notation and AS keyword to avoid confusion. Ex. users who join at least 2 groups
```
SELECT * FROM User u
  WHERE EXISTS(
  	SELECT * FROM Member m
  	WHERE uid= u.uid  --> the Member m's uid
  	AND EXISTS(
  		SELECT * FROM Member
  		WHERE uid= u.uid  -->  Member table's uid = the above User u's uid
  		AND gid<> m.gid));
```

### Quantified subqueries
Forall: `Where x op ALL(subquery)`
- `SELECT * FROM User WHERE pop >= ALL(SELECT pop FROM User);`

Exists: `Where x op ANY(subquery)`
- `SELECT * FROM User WHERE NOT (pop < ANY(SELECT pop FROM User));`
- `SELECT * FROM User AS u1 WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM User WHERE pop > u1.pop );`

# Aggregates
Count, Sum, Avg, Min, Max
- COUNT(\*) counts the number of rows, `AVG(pop)` is the avg popularity 
- `COUNT(DISTINCT uid) FROM Member` is equivalent to `COUNT(\*) FROM(SELECT DISTINCT uid FROM Member)`

## Grouping
Semantics of SELECT..FROM..WHERE..GROUP BY
- FROM (cartesian product)
- WHERE (selection, sigma)
- GROUP BY: groups rows according to the values of GROUP BY columns
	- tuples with the same value on all attributes in the group by clause are placed in one group.
- SELECT (project) fo each group. If there is DISTINCT, first eliminates duplicates within the group
- the number of groups is the number of rows in the final output.

If a query uses aggregation, every column in `SELECT` must be either aggregated or a group by column, so that the select produces only one value for each group
- `SELECT uid FROM user GROUP BY age` doesn't work because there is one output row per group, but there can be multiple uid values per group. 


## HAVING
Filters groups based on conditions, it does the GROUP BY before HAVING (another sigma over the groups), then computes SELECT for each group that passes HAVING. 
- `SELECT age, AVG(pop) FROM user GROUP BY age HAVING COUNT(*) > 100` gets the avg popularity for each age group with more than 100 users. 

## ORDER BY
ORDER BY output_column[ASC/DESC] sorts the output. Can sort by multiple columns (`ORDER BY pop DESC, name`)

# Null Value
Used when there is no data available (ex. user just made account. has no popularity)

Operations on NULL
- NULL +/- anything = NULL
- COUNT(\*) includes null since it counts rows. Other aggregates ignore it
- There is a UNKNOWN logic value (0.5) 
	- AND is min, OR is max, NOT is 1 - x (so comparing a NULL with anything else returns NULL/UNKNOWN)
	- WHERE and HAVING only select 1 (TRUE)

Use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`, never `= NULL` (will never be true)
- technically can still use `SELECT * FROM User EXCEPT ALL SELECT * FROM User WHERE pop = pop`

`SELECT AVG(pop) FROM User; vs SELECT SUM(pop)/COUNT(\*) FROM User;` is not equivalent
- Although AVG(pop)=SUM(pop)/COUNT(pop)

`SELECT * FROM User` is not equivalent to `SELECT * FROM User WHERE pop = pop;`

## Outer Join
Full outer join: includes everything in R natural join S, plus
- “Dangling” R rows (those that do not join with any S rows) padded with NULL’s for S’s columns
- “Dangling” S rows (those that do not join with any R rows) padded with NULL’s for R’s columns

Left join: includes dangling R rows padded with null

Right join: includes dangling S rows padded with null

# Insert and delete
Can insert one row or the result of a query
- `INSERT INTO Member (SELECT uid, 'group1' FROM User WHERE uid NOT IN (SELECT uid FROM Member WHERE gid='group1'));` -> Everyone joins group1

Can delete everything, or delete according to a WHERE condition
- `DELETE FROM Member WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid FROM User WHERE age<18) AND gid="NuclearWorkers"` -> users under age 18 can't be nuclear workers

Update: `UPDATE User SET pop = (SELECT AVG(pop) FROM User);` -> sets everyone to the avg population from the old table. subqueries are always computed from the old table
- Case: `update instructor set salary = case when salary <= 100000 then salary * 1.05 else salary * 1.03 end`
